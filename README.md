# odin-recipes

The current project has been updated to use html and css
 and displays cooking recipes. The project also only 
 displays 3 links to different recipes.
In this project it uses unordered lists, 
ordered lists, images, bolding, heading, paragraphs,
 and linking to different
pages. For CSS, it uses background colors, border,
font, font family, font size.

I've also learned how to use the terminal to create
git commits and push files into my github repo.

I've learned to apply CSS and its different classes
to not reuse similar code for styling.
