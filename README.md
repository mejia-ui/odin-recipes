# odin-recipes

The current project uses only html and displays
cooking recipes. The project also only 
 displays 3 links to different recipes.
In this project it uses unordered lists, 
ordered lists, images, bolding, heading, paragraphs,
 and linking to different
pages.

I've also learned how to use the terminal to create
git commits and push files into my github repo.
